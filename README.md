# survey-items

Idea: let anyone find semantically similar question items in multiple questionnaires of international survey programmes by presenting questionnaire items as a semantic similarity network where nodes are labels in actual datasets and edges represent semantic similarity scores. 

As a termporal solution, individual graphs for each survey are displayed and then a semantic search is provided to seach in all included surveys.
